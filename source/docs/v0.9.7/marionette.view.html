<h1>Marionette.View</h1>

<p>Marionette has a base <code>Marionette.View</code> type that other views extend from.
This base view provides some common and core functionality for
other views to take advantage of.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>Marionette.View</code> type is not intended to be 
used directly. It exists as a base view for other view types
to be extended from, and to provide a common location for
behaviors that are shared across all views.</p>

<h2>View.triggers</h2>

<p>Views can define a set of <code>triggers</code> as a hash, which will 
convert a DOM event in to a <code>view.trigger</code> event.</p>

<p>The left side of the hash is a standard Backbone.View DOM
event configuration, while the right side of the hash is the
view event that you want to trigger from the view.</p>

<pre><code class="js">MyView = Backbone.Marionette.ItemView.extend({
  // ...

  triggers: {
    &quot;click .do-something&quot;: &quot;something:do:it&quot;
  }
});

view = new MyView();
view.render();

view.on(&quot;something:do:it&quot;, function(){
  alert(&quot;I DID IT!&quot;);
});

// &quot;click&quot; the &#39;do-something&#39; DOM element to 
// demonstrate the DOM event conversion
view.$(&quot;.do-something&quot;).trigger(&quot;click&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>The result of this is an alert box that says, &quot;I DID IT!&quot;</p>

<p>You can also specify the <code>triggers</code> as a function that 
returns a hash of trigger configurations</p>

<pre><code class="js">Backbone.Marionette.CompositeView.extend({
  triggers: function(){
    return {
      &quot;click .that-thing&quot;: &quot;that:i:sent:you&quot;
    };
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Triggers work with all View types that extend from the base
Marionette.View.</p>

<h2>View.serializeData</h2>

<p>The <code>serializeData</code> method will serialize a view&#39;s model or
collection - with precedence given to collections. That is,
if you have both a collection and a model in a view, calling
the <code>serializeData</code> method will return the serialized
collection.</p>

<h2>View.templateHelpers</h2>

<p>There are times when a view&#39;s template needs to have some
logic in it, and the view engine itself will not provide an
easy way to accomplish this. For example, Underscore templates
do not provide a helper method mechanism while Handlebars
templates do.</p>

<p>A <code>templateHelpers</code> attribute can be applied to any View object
that uses the <code>serializeData</code> method - including ItemViews,
Layouts and CompositeViews. When this attribute is present,
it&#39;s contents will be mixed in to the data object that comes
back from the <code>serializeData</code> method for you. This will 
allow you to create helper methods that can be called from
within your templates.</p>

<h2>View.bindUIElements</h2>

<p>In several cases you need to access ui elements inside the view
to retrieve their data or manipulate them. For example you have a
certain div element you need to show/hide based on some state,
or other ui element that you wish to set a css class to it.
Instead of having jQuery selectors hanging around in the view&#39;s code
you can define a <code>ui</code> hash that contains a mapping between the
ui element&#39;s name and its jQuery selector. Afterwards you can simply
access it via <code>this.ui.elementName</code>.
See ItemView documentation for examples.</p>

<p>This functionality is provided via the <code>bindUIElements</code> method.
Since View doesn&#39;t implement the render method, then if you directly extend
from View you will need to invoke this method from your render method.
In ItemView and CompositeView this is already taken care of.</p>

<h2>Change Which Template Is Rendered For A View</h2>

<p>There may be some cases where you need to change the template that is
used for a view, based on some simple logic such as the value of a
specific attribute in the view&#39;s model. To do this, you can provide
a <code>getTemplate</code> function on your views and use this to return the
template that you need.</p>

<pre><code class="js">MyView = Backbone.Marionette.ItemView.extend({
  getTemplate: function(){
    if (this.model.get(&quot;foo&quot;)){
      return &quot;#some-template&quot;;
    } else {
      return &quot;#a-different-template&quot;;
    }
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>This applies to all view types.</p>

<h3>Basic Example</h3>

<pre><code class="html">&lt;script id=&quot;my-template&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot;&gt;
  I think that &lt;%= showMessage() %&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="js">MyView = Backbone.Marionette.ItemView.extend({
  template: &quot;#my-template&quot;,

  templateHelpers: {
    showMessage: function(){
      return this.name + &quot; is the coolest!&quot;
    }
  }

});

model = new Backbone.Model({name: &quot;Backbone.Marionette&quot;});
view = new MyView({
  model: model
});

view.render(); //=&gt; &quot;I think that Backbone.Marionette is the coolest!&quot;;
</code></pre>

<h3>Accessing Data Within The Helpers</h3>

<p>In order to access data from within the helper methods, you
need to prefix the data you need with <code>this</code>. Doing that will
give you all of the methods and attributes of the serialized
data object, including the other helper methods.</p>

<pre><code class="js">templateHelpers: {
  something: function(){
    return &quot;Do stuff with &quot; + this.name + &quot; because it&#39;s awesome.&quot;;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Object Or Function As <code>templateHelpers</code></h3>

<p>You can specify an object literal (as shown above), a reference
to an object literal, or a function as the <code>templateHelpers</code>. </p>

<p>If you specify a function, the function will be invoked 
with the current view instance as the context of the 
function. The function must return an object that can be
mixed in to the data for the view.</p>

<pre><code class="js">Backbone.Marionette.ItemView.extend({
  templateHelpers: function(){
    return {
      foo: function(){ /* ... */ }
    }
  }
});
</code></pre>
