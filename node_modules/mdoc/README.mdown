# mdoc - a simple markdown based documentation generator

This is a simple markdown based documentation generator, it will search all the
markdown files inside the "input" directory and output an HTML file for each
document, it will also generate a "TOC" (table of contents) for each file and
links to all the pages on the index page, it also provides a basic search
feature and quick browsing between classes/methods/properties.

Reasoning behind it: [inline documentation, why I'm ditching it](http://blog.millermedeiros.com/2011/03/inline-documentation-why-im-ditching-it/).



## Markdown syntax

mdoc uses the github "codeblock syntax" to highlight code. E.g.:


    ```js
      //code will be highlighted as JavaScript
    ```

    ```python
      //code will be highlighted as Python
    ```

Currently the parser considers H2 as sections/methods/properties names and will add them
to the TOC at the top of each file and automatically generate deep-links to them.
It's important to notice that **mdoc only recognizes headers on the atx-style as a
new section**.

The first paragraph after the H2 will be used as description on the sidebar. Currently
the search feature only searches copy from the title and description.

And also check the structure of the example files.



## Install

You can install it through [NPM](http://npmjs.org):

    npm install -g mdoc



## Examples

For a live example check: [MOUT documentation](http://moutjs.com/docs/latest/)
or the [**unofficial** NodeJS api](http://millermedeiros.github.com/mdoc/examples/node_api/doc/)
(uses markdown files from [nodejs repository](https://github.com/joyent/node/tree/master/doc/api) as source)

### Command line interface

    mdoc -i examples/basic/content -o examples/basic/out

For a list of available commands run:

    mdoc -h


### Node module

Check files inside the "examples" folder. Run:

    cd examples/basic
    node build.js

Check output inside "examples/basic/doc".

Check "examples/advanced" for all the available settings.



## Contributing

There are lots of things to improve, check the [issues page](https://github.com/millermedeiros/mdoc/issues)
for a list of bugs and feature requests.

I probably won't have free time to work on it till next year, any help is welcome.
(it also keeps me more motivated)
